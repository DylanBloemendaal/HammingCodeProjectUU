# HammingCodeProjectUU
### Overview:
This Python script implements a Hamming code generator and corrector. The Hamming Codes are created using either Matrix Multiplication or Bit-Wise operation.

### Features:
- Code Converter: Convert text to data bits or data bits to text. <br />
- Code Generation: Create Hamming codes by adding parity bits to the original data bits. <br />
- Error Detection: Identify errors in received Hamming codes using calculated parity bits. <br />
- Error Correction: Correct single-bit errors in Hamming codes.

## Usage:
### How to Install:
Make sure python is installed and open the .py file using any python editor.

### How to Use:
We have created 2 classes and 10 functions to be used.

#### Classes:
_Vector class:_ <br />
To use this class, input a list representing the vector, Vector operations that have been defined are: <br />
- Vector addition <br />
- Matrix and Vector multiplication

_Matrix class:_ <br />
To use this class, input a netsed list of lists where each list represents a row of the Matrix, Matrix operations that have been defined are: 
- Matrix addition,
- Matrix multiplication,
- Matrix and Vector multiplication

#### Functions:
Below are examples of how to use the functions we have made: <br />

_toBinary_

_EncodeNibble_

_EncodeBitwise_

_EncodeMessage_

_EncodeRandom_

_Parity_

_BitParity_

_DecodeHamming_

_DecodeMessage_

_toString_
